            <h2>Books and Teaching</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Since Spring 2021, <ins style="color: blue;">Karen Levy</ins> and I have been teaching a course entitled <ins style="color: blue;">Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340).</ins> The course is designed at an introductory
                    level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.</li>
                <li>D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. <ins style="color: blue;">Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World.</ins> Cambridge University Press, 2010.</li>
                <ul><li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled <ins style="color: blue;">Networks.</ins> The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal
                    prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
                <li>There is an on-line <ins style="color: blue;">edX</ins> course based on the book: <ins style="color: blue;">Networks, Crowds, and Markets,</ins> taught jointly with David Easley and Eva Tardos.</li></ul>
                <li>J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. <INS style="color: blue;">Algorithm Design.</INS> Addison Wesley, 2005.</li>
                <ul><li>This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate algorithms course.</li></ul>
                <li>I teach a PhD-level course on network models, entitled <ins style="color: blue;">The Structure of Information Networks</ins> (CS 6850).</li>
